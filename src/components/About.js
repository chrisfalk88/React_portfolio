<h1 class="title"> About Me </h1>

<h3><b>Personal</b></h3>
<p>My name is Chris Falk. I was born in Mesa but raised in Prescott.
    Shortly after high school I left town, never to return.</p>
<p> I spent some time at a seminary in Murrieta, California and eventually ended up in Seattle where I
    spent the next 10 years before moving back to The East Valley.</p>
<p>I have two Boys, a loving and beautiful wife and one cat.</p>
<p>When I am not perfecting my coding skills or working, I enjoy reading and following my Arizona
    Cardinals.</p>
<h3><b>Professional</b></h3>
<p>After majoring in Religion, I naturally went into IT.</p>
<p> My IT journey started with phone support at Starbucksâ€™ corporate office in SoDo.</p>
<p>I was then hired to do Desktop Support at SAP Concur and quickly moved up the ranks to a Project
    Coordinator for internal IT projects, specifically surround conference room technologies in new office construction. </p>
<h3><b>Possibilities</b></h3>
<p>I am currently enrolled in the U of A web development program to add some technical skillsets to
    my tool belt. </p>
<p>Outside of a complete career change into development, my goal is to use these newly minted skills
    in a product integration or implementation role within SAP.</p>
